You are an expert in object recognition and
spatial reasoning .
### Task Description ###
Analyze an image with numbered objects and
determine their relationships .
For each pair of related objects , output a JSON
object containing the relationship details .
Ensure you output all possible relationships , even
those that may be difficult to judge or less
obvious .
### Relationship Definitions ###
1. ** Stack **: Object 1 is on top of Object 2 (
Object 2 supports Object 1 from below )
2. ** Lean **: Object 1 is leaning against Object 2
( Object 2 supports Object 1 laterally )
3. ** Hang **: Object 1 is hanging from Object 2 (
Object 2 supports Object 1 from above )
4. ** Clamped **: Object 1 is clamped by Object 2 (
Object 2 grips Object 1 on multiple sides )
5. ** Contained **: Object 1 is inside Object 2 (
Object 2 encloses Object 1)
6. ** Edge / Point **: Object 1 is touching Object 2
at an edge or point ( minimal contact , no
significant support )
### Important Note ###
Only objects that are in contact with each other
should have a relationship .
For each relationship , always ensure the following
:
1. Use the correct relationship type .
2. Provide a clear explanation of the relationship
.
3. For cases that are in contact but hard to
choose which type , use " Stack ".
### Output Format ###
{
' pair': [ obj1_num , obj2_num ] ,
' relationship': ' Stack'/' Lean'/' Hang'/' Clamped
'/' Contained'/' Edge / Point'
,
' reason ': ' explanation'
}
### Examples ###
{' pair': [1 , 2] ,' relationship': ' Stack'
,
reason ': ' Book (1) is stacked on top of Table
(2)' }
{' pair': [3 , 4] ,' relationship': ' Lean'
'
,
reason ': 'A chair (3) is leaning against a
wall (4)' }
{' pair': [5 , 6] ,' relationship': ' Hang'
'
,
reason ': 'A lamp (5) is hanging from the
ceiling (6)' }
{' pair': [7 , 8] ,' relationship': ' Clamped'
'
,
reason ': 'A pipe (7) is clamped by a bracket
(8)' }
{' pair': [9 , 10] ,' relationship': ' Contained'
'
,
reason ': 'A pencil (9) is inside a pencil case
(10)' }
{' pair': [11 ,12] ,' relationship': ' Edge / Point'
'
,
reason ': 'A book (11) and a pen (12) are
touching at the edge' }
Only objects that are in contact with each other
should have a relationship .
